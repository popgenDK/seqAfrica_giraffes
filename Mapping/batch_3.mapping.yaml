Options:
  # Sequencing platform, see SAM/BAM reference for valid values
  Platform: Illumina
  # Quality offset for Phred scores, either 33 (Sanger/Illumina 1.8+)
  # or 64 (Illumina 1.3+ / 1.5+). For Bowtie2 it is also possible to
  # specify 'Solexa', to handle reads on the Solexa scale. This is
  # used during adapter-trimming and sequence alignment
  QualityOffset: 33

  # Settings for trimming of reads, see AdapterRemoval man-page
  AdapterRemoval:
     # Set and uncomment to override defaults adapter sequences
     --adapter1: AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA
     --adapter2: AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT
     # Some BAM pipeline defaults differ from AR defaults;
     # To override, change these value(s):
     --mm: 3
     --minlength: 1
     # Extra features enabled by default; change 'yes' to 'no' to disable
     --collapse:
     --collapse-conservatively:

  # Settings for aligners supported by the pipeline
  Aligners:
    # Choice of aligner software to use, either "BWA" or "Bowtie2"
    Program: BWA

    # Settings for mappings performed using BWA
    BWA:
      # One of "backtrack", "bwasw", or "mem"; see the BWA documentation
      # for a description of each algorithm (defaults to 'backtrack')
      Algorithm: mem
      # Filter aligned reads with a mapping quality (Phred) below this value
      MinQuality: 0
      # Filter reads that did not map to the reference sequence
      FilterUnmappedReads: no
      # May be disabled ("no") for aDNA alignments with the 'aln' algorithm.
      # Post-mortem damage localizes to the seed region, which BWA expects to
      # have few errors (sets "-l"). See http://pmid.us/22574660
      UseSeed: yes
      # Additional command-line options may be specified below. For 'backtrack' these
      # are applied to the "bwa aln". See Bowtie2 for more examples.
#      -n: 0.04

  # Command-line options for mapDamage; use long-form options(--length not -l):
  mapDamage:
    # By default, the pipeline will downsample the input to 100k hits
    # when running mapDamage; remove to use all hits
    --downsample: 100000

  # Set to 'yes' exclude a type of trimmed reads from alignment / analysis;
  # possible read-types reflect the output of AdapterRemoval
  ExcludeReads:
    # Exclude single-end reads (yes / no)?
    Single: no
    # Exclude non-collapsed paired-end reads (yes / no)?
    Paired: no
    # Exclude paired-end reads for which the mate was discarded (yes / no)?
    Singleton: no
    # Exclude overlapping paired-ended reads collapsed into a single sequence
    # by AdapterRemoval (yes / no)?
    Collapsed: no
    # Like 'Collapsed', but only for collapsed reads truncated due to the
    # presence of ambiguous or low quality bases at read termini (yes / no).
    CollapsedTruncated: no

  # Optional steps to perform during processing.
  Features:
    # If set to 'filter', PCR duplicates are removed from the output files; if set to
    # 'mark', PCR duplicates are flagged with bit 0x400, and not removed from the
    # output files; if set to 'no', the reads are assumed to not have been amplified.
    PCRDuplicates: mark
    # Set to 'no' to disable mapDamage; set to 'plots' to build basic mapDamage plots;
    # set to 'model' to build plots and post-mortem damage models; and set to 'rescale'
    # to build plots, models, and BAMs with rescaled quality scores. All analyses are
    # carried out per library.
    mapDamage: no
    # Generate coverage information for the final BAM and for each 'RegionsOfInterest'
    # specified in 'Prefixes' (yes / no).
    Coverage: no
    # Generate histograms of number of sites with a given read-depth, from 0 to 200,
    # for each BAM and for each 'RegionsOfInterest' specified in 'Prefixes' (yes / no).
    Depths: no
    # Generate summary table for each target (yes / no)
